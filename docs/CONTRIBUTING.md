## 🚢 Releasing

Maintainers with push access can publish a new GitHub Release by following these steps:

1. **Update the changelog** — Add an entry for the new version in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` under a heading like:
   ```markdown
   ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD
   ```

2. **Add the footer link** — At the bottom of `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, add:
   ```markdown
   [X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/bg-playground/BGSTM/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z
   ```

3. **Commit and push to main**
   ```bash
   git add docs/CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: release vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Create and push the tag**
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

5. **Automatic release** — The `release.yml` workflow will trigger automatically, extract the changelog section for the version, and create a GitHub Release with those notes.

> **Pre-releases:** Tags containing `-alpha`, `-beta`, or `-rc` (e.g., `v2.1.0-beta.1`) are automatically marked as pre-releases.
