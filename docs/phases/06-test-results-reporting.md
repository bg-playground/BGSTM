## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Information Overload in Reports
**Solution**: Create executive summaries, use layered reporting approach, provide drill-down capabilities, and tailor detail level to audience needs.

### Challenge: Lack of Stakeholder Engagement
**Solution**: Use visual and interactive reports, schedule regular review meetings, highlight business impact, and solicit feedback to improve reports.

### Challenge: Delayed or Inconsistent Reporting
**Solution**: Automate report generation, establish reporting schedule, use templates for consistency, and set clear deadlines and responsibilities.

### Challenge: Technical Jargon for Non-Technical Audience
**Solution**: Create audience-specific versions, use plain language, include glossary for technical terms, and focus on business impact rather than technical details.

### Challenge: Missing or Inaccurate Data
**Solution**: Implement data validation procedures, maintain single source of truth, conduct data quality checks, and clearly mark estimates or incomplete data.

## Metrics to Track
- Report delivery timeliness (on-time vs. late)
- Stakeholder satisfaction with reports
- Number of clarification requests received
- Time spent creating reports
- Report accuracy rate (corrections needed)
- Action item closure rate from reports
- Report readership/engagement metrics
- Report generation efficiency (automation level)
