# Scrum Testing Checklist

**Purpose:** Quick-reference checklist for testing activities throughout a Scrum sprint.  
**When to Use:** Reference at sprint planning, daily standups, and sprint reviews to ensure testing activities stay on track.

## Sprint Planning

### Test Planning Activities
- [ ] Review user stories and acceptance criteria with the team
- [ ] Identify testable acceptance criteria for each story
- [ ] Estimate testing effort for sprint backlog items
- [ ] Identify testing dependencies and risks
- [ ] Confirm test environment availability for the sprint
- [ ] Plan test automation tasks if applicable
- [ ] Define Definition of Done (DoD) including testing criteria
- [ ] Allocate testing tasks across sprint timeline

### Test Preparation
- [ ] Review previous sprint's test results and lessons learned
- [ ] Identify regression test scope for sprint
- [ ] Prepare test data requirements
- [ ] Set up sprint test tracking board/dashboard
- [ ] Coordinate with developers on unit testing approach

## During the Sprint

### Daily Testing Activities
- [ ] Execute test cases for completed user stories
- [ ] Participate in daily standup (report progress, blockers)
- [ ] Log defects discovered during testing
- [ ] Retest fixed defects
- [ ] Update test case execution status
- [ ] Communicate testing status to the team
- [ ] Review code commits for testability

### Continuous Testing
- [ ] Perform exploratory testing on new features
- [ ] Execute smoke tests on daily builds
- [ ] Run automated regression suite
- [ ] Validate acceptance criteria with Product Owner
- [ ] Test integration points between features
- [ ] Document new defects with reproducible steps

### Collaboration
- [ ] Attend backlog refinement sessions
- [ ] Provide testing input during implementation
- [ ] Pair with developers for complex features
- [ ] Review and test story increments as completed
- [ ] Clarify acceptance criteria ambiguities immediately

---

## Sprint Review

### Demonstration Preparation
- [ ] Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Confirm demonstration environment is stable
- [ ] Prepare test results summary
- [ ] Document known issues and workarounds
- [ ] Test user stories in demo environment

### Review Activities
- [ ] Demonstrate tested features to stakeholders
- [ ] Present test execution metrics
- [ ] Discuss defects and quality concerns
- [ ] Gather feedback on demonstrated features
- [ ] Update product backlog based on feedback

---

## Sprint Retrospective

### Testing Process Review
- [ ] Review testing effectiveness for the sprint
- [ ] Identify testing bottlenecks or delays
- [ ] Discuss defect trends and root causes
- [ ] Evaluate test automation coverage
- [ ] Assess collaboration between testers and developers
- [ ] Identify process improvements for next sprint

### Metrics to Review
- [ ] Test cases executed vs. planned
- [ ] Defect detection rate
- [ ] Defect fix rate
- [ ] Test automation coverage
- [ ] Testing cycle time
- [ ] Escaped defects to production

### Action Items
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Identify process improvement actions
- [ ] Update test strategy if needed
- [ ] Plan for test automation enhancements
- [ ] Schedule knowledge sharing sessions

---

## Continuous Activities

### Throughout Sprint
- [ ] Maintain test case repository
- [ ] Update traceability matrix
- [ ] Refine automated test scripts
- [ ] Monitor test environment health
- [ ] Track and triage defects
- [ ] Communicate risks to team immediately

### Documentation
- [ ] Keep test execution status current
- [ ] Document test results and evidence
- [ ] Update sprint test report
- [ ] Maintain defect log
- [ ] Record testing decisions and rationale
