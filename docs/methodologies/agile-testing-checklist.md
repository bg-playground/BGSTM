## Iteration Planning

### Planning Activities
- [ ] Review iteration scope and user stories
- [ ] Identify testable requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Estimate testing effort for planned work
- [ ] Assess testing risks and dependencies
- [ ] Plan test automation opportunities
- [ ] Define iteration testing goals
- [ ] Allocate testing resources

### Preparation
- [ ] Set up test environment for iteration
- [ ] Prepare necessary test data
- [ ] Review and update existing test suites

## During Iteration

### Continuous Testing
- [ ] Test features incrementally as completed
- [ ] Perform exploratory testing daily
- [ ] Execute automated regression tests
- [ ] Validate against acceptance criteria
- [ ] Test integrations between components
- [ ] Conduct usability testing where applicable

### Test Execution
- [ ] Execute planned test cases
- [ ] Document test results
- [ ] Log defects with clear reproduction steps
- [ ] Retest resolved defects
- [ ] Update test execution metrics
- [ ] Communicate progress to team

### Defect Management
- [ ] Triage new defects daily
- [ ] Prioritize defects with team
- [ ] Verify defect fixes
- [ ] Track defect resolution progress
- [ ] Escalate blocked defects
- [ ] Document workarounds if needed

### Collaboration
- [ ] Participate in daily standups
- [ ] Pair with developers on complex features
- [ ] Review code for testability
- [ ] Provide early feedback on implementation
- [ ] Clarify requirements with Product Owner
- [ ] Share testing insights with team
