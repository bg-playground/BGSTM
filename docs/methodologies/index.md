# Testing Methodologies

BGSTM is methodology-agnostic and can be adapted to various software development approaches. This section provides specific guidance for implementing BGSTM within different methodologies.

## Supported Methodologies

### [Agile Testing](agile.md)
Continuous testing with rapid feedback cycles, emphasizing collaboration and adaptability.

**Best For:** Iterative development, frequent releases, evolving requirements

---

### [Scrum Testing](scrum.md)
Sprint-based testing approach integrated into Scrum ceremonies and artifacts.

**Best For:** Time-boxed sprints, cross-functional teams, product backlogs

---

### [Waterfall Testing](waterfall.md)
Sequential phase-based testing with formal stage gates and comprehensive documentation.

**Best For:** Well-defined requirements, regulated industries, fixed-scope projects

## Adapting BGSTM

All six phases of BGSTM can be adapted to your chosen methodology:

| Phase | Agile/Scrum | Waterfall |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Test Planning | Sprint/Iteration Planning | Dedicated Planning Phase |
| Test Case Development | Continuous, Story-Based | Upfront, Complete |
| Environment Preparation | Continuous Integration | Formal Environment Setup |
| Test Execution | Throughout Sprint | Dedicated Testing Phase |
| Results Analysis | Sprint Review/Retro | Phase Gate Review |
| Results Reporting | Sprint Reports | Comprehensive Phase Reports |
