# BGSTM - Professional Software Testing Framework

**BGSTM** (Better Global Software Testing Methodology) is a comprehensive, professional software testing framework adaptable to various software development methodologies including Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall.

## 🎯 Overview

This framework provides a structured approach to software testing through six core phases, with detailed guidance for implementing testing practices across different project methodologies. It serves as both a knowledge base for testing professionals and a foundation for building multi-platform testing management applications.
