**BGSTM** (Better Global Software Testing Methodology) is a comprehensive, professional software testing framework adaptable to various software development methodologies including Agile, Scrum, and Waterfall.

## 🎯 Overview

This framework provides a structured approach to software testing through six core phases, with detailed guidance for implementing testing practices across different project methodologies. It serves as both a knowledge base for testing professionals and a foundation for building multi-platform testing management applications.

## 🔄 Six Phases of Software Testing

1. **[Test Planning](docs/phases/01-test-planning.md)** - Define scope, strategy, resources, and timelines
2. **[Test Case Development](docs/phases/02-test-case-development.md)** - Design and document test scenarios and cases
3. **[Test Environment Preparation](docs/phases/03-test-environment-preparation.md)** - Set up infrastructure and tools
4. **[Test Execution](docs/phases/04-test-execution.md)** - Execute tests and manage defects
5. **[Test Results Analysis](docs/phases/05-test-results-analysis.md)** - Analyze outcomes and identify patterns
6. **[Test Results Reporting](docs/phases/06-test-results-reporting.md)** - Communicate findings to stakeholders

## 🔧 Methodology Guides

- **[Agile Testing](docs/methodologies/agile.md)** - Continuous testing with rapid feedback
- **[Scrum Testing](docs/methodologies/scrum.md)** - Sprint-based testing approach
- **[Waterfall Testing](docs/methodologies/waterfall.md)** - Sequential phase-based testing
- **[Methodology Comparison](docs/methodologies/comparison.md)** - Detailed comparison and selection guide

## 📋 Templates & Resources

- **[Templates](docs/templates/README.md)** - Ready-to-use templates for test plans, test cases, and reports
- **[Examples](docs/examples/README.md)** - Practical examples and sample artifacts
- **[Multi-Platform App Guide](docs/integration/multi-platform-guide.md)** - Build testing management applications

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Methodology Agnostic** - Adaptable to Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, and hybrid approaches
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage** - End-to-end testing process from planning to reporting
- ✅ **Professional Standards** - Industry best practices and quality standards
- ✅ **Practical Templates** - Ready-to-use templates for immediate implementation
- ✅ **Scalable** - Suitable for projects of all sizes
- ✅ **App-Ready** - Foundation for building testing management tools

## 🛠️ Building a Multi-Platform App

This framework can serve as the foundation for building comprehensive testing management applications. See our [Multi-Platform App Integration Guide](docs/integration/multi-platform-guide.md) for:

- Recommended technology stacks
- Application architecture
- Core features and modules
- API design
- Development roadmap
- Implementation considerations

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get a fully working demo environment running with a single command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bg-playground/BGSTM.git
cd BGSTM
./setup.sh        # macOS/Linux
setup.bat          # Windows
```

The setup script will:
- Check for Docker / Docker Compose
- Create `.env` from `.env.example` automatically
- Build and start all services (backend, frontend, Postgres)
- Wait for every service to be healthy
- Optionally load sample data
- Open the browser to `http://localhost`

| Service     | URL                          |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Frontend    | http://localhost              |
| Backend API | http://localhost:8000         |
| API Docs    | http://localhost:8000/docs    |

```bash
docker compose down      # stop services (or: docker-compose down)
docker compose logs -f   # view logs   (or: docker-compose logs -f)
```

## 🛠️ Manual Setup

### Frontend + Backend (Docker Compose)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bg-playground/BGSTM.git
cd BGSTM

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services (database, backend, frontend)
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application
# Frontend: http://localhost
# Backend API: http://localhost:8000
# API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
```

### Frontend Development

To run the frontend locally for development:

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### Backend Development

To run the backend locally:

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up database (PostgreSQL)
# Update DATABASE_URL in .env file
