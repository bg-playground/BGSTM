## 🧹 Closing — Superseded

This lint-only fix (trailing newline + import sort for `test_analytics.py`) is superseded by **PR #92**, which includes the complete analytics service implementation with properly formatted files.

Additionally, **PR #95** (merged) added a CI auto-fix step (`ruff check --fix && ruff format`) that prevents this class of lint issue from blocking future PRs.

**Action:** Please close this PR and delete the `copilot/fix-linting-error-in-tests` branch.
